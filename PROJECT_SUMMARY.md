# Project Goal and High-Level Architecture

## Main Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a cookie-based stealth browser agent system. This system is designed to operate with a high degree of anonymity and emulate human-like browsing behavior to avoid detection by web services.

## Key Characteristics

The project emphasizes the following key characteristics:

*   **Anti-Detection:** A core focus is on implementing robust stealth mechanisms to prevent the agent from being identified as automated software. This includes techniques to bypass common bot detection systems.
*   **Human-Like Behavior:** The agent aims to mimic human browsing patterns, such as realistic mouse movements, typing speeds, and interaction with web elements.
*   **AI Integration:** The system plans to integrate with AI models to enhance its capabilities. Specific mentions include:
    *   Gemini API (as per `README.md`)
    *   "Matrix AI" (suggested by filenames like `matrix_ai_core.py`, `matrix_ai_utils.py`)
    *   HuggingFace smolagents (as per `TODO.md`)

## Core Components

Based on the file structure and `TODO.md`, the system appears to be composed of the following core components:

*   **Browser Automation:** This is likely handled by a library such as Selenium, as suggested by filenames like `browser_agent_stealth.py`. This component will be responsible for controlling browser actions.
*   **Cookie Management:** A dedicated `cookie_manager.py` suggests sophisticated handling of browser cookies, which is crucial for maintaining sessions and mimicking user profiles.
*   **Stealth and Anti-Detection Mechanisms:** While not tied to a single file, the emphasis on anti-detection implies that various modules and techniques will be implemented to ensure the agent remains undetected. This could involve modifying browser fingerprints, randomizing behavior, and handling CAPTCHAs.
*   **AI Integrations:** Files such as `matrix_ai_core.py`, `matrix_ai_models.py`, and `matrix_ai_utils.py` point towards a dedicated module or set of modules for integrating and managing AI functionalities within the agent system.
*   **Web Frontend:** The `README.md` mentions a Node.js based web frontend, suggesting a user interface for controlling or monitoring the agent system.
*   **Utilities and Core Logic:** Files like `utils.py` and potentially `matrix_ai_core.py` will likely contain shared functionalities and the central logic orchestrating the different components.
*   **Configuration Management:** A `config.py` file indicates that the system will have configurable parameters, allowing for flexibility and adaptation to different scenarios.
*   **Testing and Examples:** The presence of `tests` directory and `examples` (implied by `TODO.md` task to add examples) suggests a commitment to testing and providing usage demonstrations.
